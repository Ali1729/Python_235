Hierarchy

    1. Programs are composed of modules.
    2. Modules contain statements.
    3. Statements contain expressions.
    4. Expressions create and process objects.

Python is a dynamically typed language.

    what are the problems of having a dynamically typed language.



Built-in objects make programs easy to write. 
Built-in objects are components of extensions
Built-in objects are often more efficient than custom data structures.
Built-in objects are a standard part of the language.

Numbers.

    Number related modules.
        random
        random.choice([1,2,3,4])
        random.random()
        random.randint()

    Number Operators.
        Division operator. (classic division and floor division)
        % operator.

        Comparison operators

    Number related modules.
       math modules.
       Math.floor()
       math.trunc()


lists and strings I
    Only introduction 
    length

    empty


Variables:
    Shared references.
    id 



Strings II
    double quotes
    single quotes
    escape sequences
    raw strings
    concatenate two strings
    repeat

    index, slice
    str.find(a)




Two kind of functions you see


Lists II
    Ordered collections of arbitrary objects
    Accessed by offset
    Variable-length, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily nestable
    Mutable.


    L * 3
    for x in L: print(x)
    3 in L
    Iteration, membership
    L.append(4)
    L.extend([5,6,7])
    L.insert(i, X)
    Methods: growing
    L.index(X)
    L.count(X)
    Methods: searching
    L.sort()
    L.reverse()
    L.copy()
    L.clear()
    Methods: sorting, reversing,
    copying (3.3+), clearing (3.3+)
    L.pop(i)
    L.remove(X)
    del L[i]
    del L[i:j]
    L[i:j] = []
    Methods, statements: shrinking
    L[i] = 3
    L[i:j] = [4,5,6]
    Index assignment, slice assignment
    L = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
    list(map(ord, 'spam'))


Excercies
1. Write a Python program that declares two variables, "x" and "y", and assigns them values of 5 and 3, respectively. Then, using math operations, print out the result of "x" raised to the power of "y".
2. reverse of a string
3. Capitalize first letter in each word of a given string.

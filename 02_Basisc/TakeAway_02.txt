Hierarchy

    1. Programs are composed of modules.
    2. Modules contain statements.
    3. Statements contain expressions.
    4. Expressions create and process objects.

Python is a dynamically typed language.

    what are the problems of having a dynamically typed language.



Built-in objects make programs easy to write. 
Built-in objects are components of extensions
Built-in objects are often more efficient than custom data structures.
Built-in objects are a standard part of the language.

Numbers.

    Number related modules.
        random
        random.choice([1,2,3,4])
        random.random()
        random.randint()

    Number Operators.
        Division operator. (classic division and floor division)
        % operator.

        Comparison operators

    Number related modules.
       math modules.
       Math.floor()
       math.trunc()


lists and strings I
    Only introduction 
    length

    empty


Variables:

    id 



Strings II
    double quotes
    single quotes
    escape sequences
    raw strings
    concatenate two strings
    repeat

    index, slice
    str.find(a)




Two kind of functions you see



Excercies
1. Write a Python program that declares two variables, "x" and "y", and assigns them values of 5 and 3, respectively. Then, using math operations, print out the result of "x" raised to the power of "y".
2. reverse of a string


3. Capitalize first letter in each word of a given string.
